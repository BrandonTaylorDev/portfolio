      <p>
        I am a results-driven engineer with over a decade of experience in on-premises and cloud infrastructure,
        as well as a broad range of development technologies. Passionate about leadership and innovation,
        I thrive on the creativity involved in designing and building solutions. My career began with freelance web development,
        and since then, I've had the privilege of working across diverse technologies and industries.
        I have leveraged Kubernetes, highly available Linux systems, Azure, and AWS to support healthcare providers and supply chain solutions.
